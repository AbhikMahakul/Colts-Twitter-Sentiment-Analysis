<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>As a fan of the Indianapolis Colts, I am intrigued by the possible Twitter sentiment pertaining to the team. 
To gauge the sentiment, I am scraping tweets with the Colts twitter handle, and the following hashtags: Colts and ForTheShoe. As for why I chose my hashtags, I know that #Colts is commonly used by Colts fans when tweeting about the Indianapolis Colts. The hashtag #ForTheShoe is the Colts motto, and it is in the twitter bio. For the Shoe phrase that is heavily used by fans, players, and the owner therefore, it is very likely that this hashtag will pertain to the Indianapolis Colts.</p>

<h2>Sentiment Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall the sentiment for the Indianapolis Colts is fairly positive. Most tweets are positive Although the second most tweets are negative, the third, fourth, and fifth highest tweets are trust, anticipation, and joy. All this being said, the sentiment is good for the Colts, and things appear to be headed the right way. As for how sentiment impacts the Colts, I’d imagine the more positive the sentiment, the higher the ticket sales, fan attendance, merchandise sales, player morale, and appeal to free agents will be. Overall the sentiment is inline with what I am reading about the Colts. This offseason, the Colts made major moves such as releasing Carson Wentz, adding young talent in the draft, and signing Stephon GIlmore and trading for Yannick Ngackoue. These moves have made our roster better, which has led to a more positive outlook for the team.</p>

<h2> How is sentiment useful, and how should the Colts use this information?</h2>
<p>Sentiment analysis is very useful when it comes to analyzing unstructured data. In addition to the hashtags which were analyzed, each home game and Colts event has a hashtag which can be used to analyze how the sentiment pertaining to a game or event. The Colts also sent annual season ticket holder surveys. In addition to quantitative questions, they ask a lot of free response questions. Combining structured and unstructured data gives a much clearer picture on a season ticket holder’s experience. It allows the Colts to correlate sentiment with scores which provides valuable insights. As for additional analysis, for a small market team to be financially successful, winning is essential. Additional analysis would entail using the nflplotr package which can be used to analyze team and player stats on a play by play basis. If the Colts are able to fully harness the potential of this package they will have smarter play calling which will help their team perform better. Other techniques would be using sensors to monitor player data (nutrition, work, energy, and ,etc). This data can be used to help improve a players performance and hopefully reduce injury risk. My final recommendations are that the Colts are headed in the right direction. The sentiment is positive, and they have made solid off season moves which have restored trust and built excitement with the fanbase. As for next steps, I would recommend that the Colts use analytics to optimize in game decisions, and player performance. </p>
